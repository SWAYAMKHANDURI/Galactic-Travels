<h2>ðŸŒŸ ABOUT THE TEAM</h2>
<p>The GALACTIC is a team of passionate and creative engineers and designers always looking for new challenges. We are committed to building innovative and impactful products.</p>
<p>We believe in the power of collaboration and teamwork. We are always willing to help each other out and learn from each other. We are also a lot of fun! We love coding, designing, and solving problems together.</p>

<h2>ðŸŒŸ ABOUT THE CHALLENGE</h2>
<p>In the distant future, space tourism will likely be routine for Earth dwellers. However, space travelers will need help choosing a destination and determining an itinerary. Imagine you are a travel agent at a future space tourism office. Your challenge is to create a tool that will develop not only customized itineraries for future travelers who want to visit the main bodies in our solar systemâ€”perhaps Mars, Jupiter, or Saturnâ€”but also educate present-day users about the many different objects in our solar system.</p>
